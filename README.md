# HCSR04sensor_with_ESP8266_ESP32
👀Project is about controlling HCSR04 UV sensor using ESP8266/ESP32.\
🧠Project needs some basic knowledge about micropython and Ide to start over\
👉I used python programming language using uPycraft Ide 💻in this project named **hcsr04prob.py**\
✍️Code includes some hcsr04 library which needs to install first in ESP board. Also refer this [page 📄](https://microcontrollerslab.com/hc-sr04-ultrasonic-esp32-esp8266-micropython/) to install the library in uPycraft.\
